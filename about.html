                <p>Our Story</p>
                <p>Classic Comfort is not just a company, it is a story of passion for creating a unique
                    and comfortable furniture that embodies exquisite 
                    style and unsurpassed quality. Our journey has begun
                     since 1980, when Matvey Alekseevich Tsvetkov decided to combine his experience and
                    inspiration to create something amazing.
